# Demo Repository

I am learning how to use git!
You will have to use git commands like:
clone - bring repo that is hosted somewhere like Github into a local folder on computer
add -  track files and changes to git
commit -  save files to git
push - upload git commits to a Git hub repo
pull -  download commits from repo to computer
